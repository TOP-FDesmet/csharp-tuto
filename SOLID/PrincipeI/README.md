## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle states that a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use. This principle encourages the creation of small, client-specific interfaces.

**Key Idea**: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesnâ€™t use.

**Real-Time Example**: You sign up for a music streaming service and only choose the genres you like, not all available genres.
