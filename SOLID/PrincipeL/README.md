##Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

Key Idea: You should be able to use any subclass where you use its parent class.

Real-Time Example: You have a remote control that works for all types of TVs, regardless of the brand.
