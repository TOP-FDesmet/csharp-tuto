## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle suggests that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you can add new features without altering existing code.

**Key Idea**: Once a class is written, it should be closed for modifications but open for extensions.

**Real-Time Example**: Your smartphone — you don’t open it up to add features; you just download apps to extend its capabilities.

### Before applying for OCP:

public class Rectangle
{
public double Width { get; set; }
public double Height { get; set; }
}

public class AreaCalculator
{
public double CalculateArea(Rectangle rectangle)
{
return rectangle.Width \* rectangle.Height;
}
}

This design may become problematic when adding new shapes. Modifying the AreaCalculator for each new shape violates the OCP.

### After applying for OCP:

public interface IShape
{
double CalculateArea();
}

public class Rectangle : IShape
{
// implementation
}

public class Circle : IShape
{
// implementation
}

By introducing an interface (IShape), new shapes like Circle can be added without modifying existing code, adhering to the OCP.

**Explanation**: According to OCP, the class should be open for extension but closed for modification. So, When you introduce a new shape, then just implement it from the interface IShape. So IShapeis open for extension but closed for further modification.
