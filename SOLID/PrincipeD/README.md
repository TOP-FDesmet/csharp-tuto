## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

**Key Idea**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

**Real-Time Example**: Building a LEGO tower â€” the bricks (high and low-level modules) connect through smaller bricks (abstractions).
